# Hey, Iâ€™m Rhyce!
Welcome! Let me tell you a bit about myself.

# ðŸ‘€ Interests
My interests are a bit all over the place. On a software side, I enjoy game and software development and on the not-at-the-computer side, I enjoy driving and being outdoors in general.

# ðŸ’» Projects

You may notice I have a couple of public projects, these aren't updated too often but I am usually working on private projects that I don't yet wish to be public.

## [Epic Games Launcher Project Path Manager](https://github.com/Rhyce/EGLProjectPathManager)
The Epic Games Launcher has a problem where projects wonâ€™t show under "My Projects" in the Epic Games Launcher. This also causes issues when adding Marketplace Assets to your project as the launcher wonâ€™t show them in the Add To Project Dialog.

This is usually because the Epic Games Launcher hasn't been told where to look for projects. The Epic Games Launcher doesn't have a built in way to manage directories where Unreal Projects are stored. You move your project elseware, the Epic Games Launcher won't be able to see it. This can be handled manually by editing the configuration for the Epic Games Launcher but this tool allows you to do it in a far easier, and visual, way.

## [UPaT](https://github.com/Rhyce/UPaT)

UPaT is a tool I built to allow interaction with UnrealPak.exe. UnrealPak.exe is the packaging tool that comes with Unreal Engine. Sometimes it can be a pain to use directly via the command line so I'm building a tool to use it instead.

Unreal Engine uses it directly in-editor when packaging games but some studios, with automated tools, use it directly.

At the moment it only handle's extracting Pak files but I am thinking of adding more features to it.

The main reason it only extracts is due to me wanting to extract the Pak files of games I didn't make, not for malicious reasons, just to see how they're built. As far as I know, you cannot make an editable project with extraction.

## [TTSTool](https://github.com/Rhyce/TTSTool)

TTS Tool is a tool I built to assist with game development. All it does is allow you to generate a text to speech file.

This assists with making placeholder voices during development of my projects.
