# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m @Rhyce

# ðŸ‘€ Interests
My interests are a bit all over the place. On a software side, I enjoy game and software development and on the not-at-the-computer side, I enjoy driving and being outdoors in general.

# ðŸ’» Projects

You may notice I have a couple of public projects, these aren't updated too often but I am usually working on private projects that I don't yet wish to be public.

## [UPaT](https://github.com/Rhyce/UPaT)

UPaT is a tool I built to allow interaction with UnrealPak.exe. UnrealPak.exe is the packaging tool that comes with Unreal Engine. Sometimes it can be a pain to use directly via the command line so I'm building a tool to use it instead.

Unreal Engine uses it directly in-editor when packaging games but some studios, with automated tools, use it directly.

At the moment it only handle's extracting Pak files but I am thinking of adding more features to it.

The main reason it only extracts is due to me wanting to extract the Pak files of games I didn't make, not for malicious reasons, just to see how they're built. As far as I know, you cannot make an editable project with extraction.

## [TTSTool](https://github.com/Rhyce/TTSTool)

TTS Tool is a tool I built to assist with game development. All it does is allow you to generate a text to speech file.

This assists with making placeholder voices during development of my projects.
