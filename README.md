# Hey, Iâ€™m Rhyce!

Welcome! Let me tell you a bit about myself.

# ðŸ‘€ Interests

My interests are a bit all over the place. On a software side, I enjoy game and software development and on the not-at-the-computer side, I enjoy driving and being outdoors in general. Yeah, I know I'm weird.

# ðŸ’» Personal Projects

You may notice I have a couple of public projects, these aren't updated too often but I am usually working on private projects that I don't yet wish to be public.

## Rhyce.dev

Rhyce.dev is my website, built with React and Next.js. I built it to replace my old website which ran on WordPress. My website is outfitted with its own media browser and post editor, allowing me to edit and create new posts when I want. The editor uses [Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor), which some may know as the editor that VSCode is built around. I also wanted to change things up, If I added the ability to allow others to create posts, I can't expect them to learn HTML and I don't want to write HTML all the time either. So I made my posts use [Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) instead which enforces styling consistency while also being simple and easy to use by, pretty much, anyone.

## Tappr

A small game made using Expo and React Native and can be found on Google Play and the App Store.

## [Epic Games Launcher Project Path Manager](https://github.com/Rhyce/EGLProjectPathManager)

The Epic Games Launcher has a problem where projects wonâ€™t show under "My Projects" in the Epic Games Launcher. This also causes issues when adding Marketplace Assets to your project as the launcher wonâ€™t show them in the Add To Project Dialog.

This is usually because the Epic Games Launcher hasn't been told where to look for projects. The Epic Games Launcher doesn't have a built-in way to manage directories where Unreal Projects are stored. If you move your project elsewhere, the Epic Games Launcher won't be able to see it. This can be handled manually by editing the configuration for the Epic Games Launcher but this tool allows you to do it in a far easier, and visual, way.

## [UPaT](https://github.com/Rhyce/UPaT)

> [!NOTE]  
> I've made this repo private for a bit while I do some extra work on it.

UPaT is a tool I built to allow interaction with UnrealPak.exe. UnrealPak.exe is the packaging tool that comes with Unreal Engine. Sometimes it can be a pain to use directly via the command line so I'm building a tool to use it instead.

Unreal Engine uses it directly in the editor when packaging games but some studios, with automated tools, use it directly.

At the moment it only handles extracting Pak files but I am thinking of adding more features to it.

The main reason it only extracts is that I wanted to extract the Pak files of games I didn't make, not for malicious reasons, just to see how they're built. As far as I know, you cannot make an editable project with extraction.

At the current time, this project has been made private while I work on a few things.

## [TTSTool](https://github.com/Rhyce/TTSTool)

TTS Tool is a tool I built to assist with game development. All it does is allow you to generate a text-to-speech file.

This assists with making placeholder voices during the development of my projects.
